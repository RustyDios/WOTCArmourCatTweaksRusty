You created an XCOM 2 Mod Project!

Yes I did make another mod project!
This one inspired by lots of previous mods that do pretty much the same thing, like these;

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1128941500 Advanced Armours For WOTC Factions
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1132085442 All Armours For WOTC Factions (mod friendly version)
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1420233940 [WOTC] All Armour For Heroes
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1536523625 [WOTC] All Armors For All Soldiers (AKA TLP Looks For All)

Always start a new campaign when turning this mod on. Do not try and turn it on part-way through an existing game.

This mod basically combines the split functionality of the first mod and puts it in the list for the last mod. 
And includes splits for the DLC ruler armours and some personal favorite mod armours.
Created for personal use but one day it might find itself uploaded to the workshop

Mod armours are from;
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1281296244 Playable Titan Armor
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1511763111 EU Psi Armor
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1835154434 Metion Battlesuit
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1918499687 The Hive
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1619292810 Chosen Reward Variety

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2212283900 ADVENT Shieldbearer
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2213094224 ADVENT Purifier
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2206139678 ADVENT Stunlancer
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2201956611 ADVENT Officer
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2192407850 ADVENT Trooper

XComClassData;
Warning: Does not play nice with mods that add new soldier classes!
Contains default ini settings for Base Game Classes and Heroes, Psionics , Lubrications Infantry, RPGO, LWOTC Classes, Proficiency Classes && ABB
Also has settings for Denmother (Keepers), Stormriders, Akimbo and Samurai
My Alchemist class already has settings in the xcomclassdata.ini of that mod

The config is pretty straight forward on how to add new classes, literally copy and paste, change the class name, remove the ;comments to allow armors

XComGame;
Contains new armor category definitions per template of the armour, anything not in the list defaults to what it was originally set as (likely 'soldier')

[h1] What is this? [/h1]
This mod is a combination of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1128941500] Advanced Armours For WOTC Factions [/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1536523625] [WOTC] All Armors For All Soldiers (AKA TLP Looks For All) [/url] .

So this mod gives you more finite control over what class can wear what armor type.

This mod basically combines the split functionality of the first mod and puts it in the list for the second mod. 
The difference is I cover more armor types, including the Alien Ruler armors and mod armors, [b]AND[/b] allow easy customization of the categories by config file.

[i]Created for personal use but was convinced to upload to the workshop.[/i] 
I'm unlikely to update and override your personal settings

[h1] Default Settings and Config[/h1]
[b]Contains default ini settings for Base Game Classes and Heroes, Psionics , Lubrications Infantry, RPGO, LWOTC Classes, Proficiency Classes && ABB
Also has settings for Denmother (Keepers), Stormriders, Akimbo and Samurai[/b]
[i]My Alchemist class already has settings in the xcomclassdata.ini of that mod[/i]

The default settings have a rough split of the armors into 'light', 'medium' and 'heavy'. Each class is assigned a subset of allowed armors based around what I believe they should be able to wear for their default role. So no sneaky Reapers stomping around in W.A.R or RAGE Suits for example, but fully able to use Spider or Wraith!

Default settings also include Proving Ground Armors, Hero Armors, TLP Armors, Ruler Armors, HIVE Armor, EU Psi Armor, Titan and Grand Titan Armor, Metion Battlesuits, Chosen Reward Variety Armors and Night Ninja's ADVENT Armors...

Thankfully everything is config editable, so please feel free to browse the config files and adjust to however [b][i]you[/i][/b] would like it to be.
The config is pretty straight forward on how to add new classes, copy and paste the template, change the class name, remove the ;comments to allow armors

Armor to Class assignment is done in 2218548449\Config\XComClassData.ini
Armor to Category assignment is done in 2218548449\Config\XComGame.ini

[h1][b] ! Warning ! [/b][/h1]
[list][*]Warning: Does not play nice with mods that add new soldier classes unless included!
[*]Default classes included listed above.[/list]
The reason is that, in order to make this work, I create new categories of armor and assign the various armors to them. 
These categories then need to be set as [i]+AllowedArmours[/i] in the X2SoldierClassTemplate in order for that class to wear/use them.
Unless a class has the extra lines required it will end up limited to [b]just[/b] the remaining items of the 'soldier' category, which will contain Base Kevlar, Predator and Warden armor.

I've been using this myself for a very long time and providing I recall the above rules, and add classes to the config, I have not had any other issues.
Bug Reports welcome.
